Traffic analysis of a malicious software download using Wireshark, identifying indicators of compromise and attack path
# Wireshark Traffic Analysis – Malicious Download from Fake Software Site

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on using **Wireshark** to capture and analyze malicious network traffic associated with a **fake software download site**.  
The objective was to detect suspicious patterns, identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), and demonstrate how network monitoring can uncover malicious activity.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Capture and analyze traffic from a simulated malicious software download.  
- Identify suspicious domains, IP addresses, and payloads.  
- Correlate malicious traffic with user activity.  
- Document findings in an incident-style report.  

---

## 🛠️ Key Tasks Completed
- Captured network traffic during download attempts.  
- Filtered packets by protocol (HTTP, DNS, TCP).  
- Identified malicious requests and abnormal behavior.  
- Mapped findings to known malware distribution patterns.  
- Suggested remediation measures (blocking domains, endpoint protection, user awareness).
